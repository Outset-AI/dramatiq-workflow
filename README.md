`dramatiq-workflow` allows running workflows (chains and groups of tasks) using
the Python background task processing library [dramatiq](https://dramatiq.io/).

## Motivation

While dramatiq allows running tasks in parallel via groups, and in sequence via
pipelines, it does not provide a way to combine these two concepts.
`dramatiq-workflow` aims to fill this gap and allows creating complex
workflows, similar to the canvas feature in Celery.

## Features

- Define workflows with tasks running in parallel and in sequence using chains
  and groups.
- Nest chains and groups of tasks to create complex workflows.
- Schedules workflows to run in the background using dramatiq.

**Note:** `dramatiq-workflow` does not support passing the results from one task
to the next one in a chain. We recommend using a database to store intermediate
results if needed.

## Installation

You can install `dramatiq-workflow` from PyPI:

```sh
pip install dramatiq-workflow
```

Then, add the `dramatiq-workflow` middleware to your dramatiq broker:

```python
from dramatiq.rate_limits.backends import RedisBackend
from dramatiq_workflow import WorkflowMiddleware

backend = RedisBackend()
broker.add_middleware(WorkflowMiddleware(backend))
```

Please refer to the [dramatiq documentation](https://dramatiq.io/guide.html)
for details on how to set up a broker.

## Example

Let's assume we want a workflow that looks like this:

```text
             ╭────────╮  ╭────────╮
             │ Task 2 │  │ Task 5 │
          ╭──┼●      ●┼──┼●      ●┼╮
╭────────╮│  ╰────────╯  ╰────────╯│  ╭────────╮
│ Task 1 ││  ╭────────╮            │  │ Task 8 │
│       ●┼╯  │ Task 3 │            ╰──┼●       │
│       ●┼───┼●      ●┼───────────────┼●       │
│       ●┼╮  ╰────────╯             ╭─┼●       │
╰────────╯│  ╭────────╮   ╭────────╮│╭┼●       │
          │  │ Task 4 │   │ Task 6 │││╰────────╯
          ╰──┼●      ●┼───┼●      ●┼╯│
             │       ●┼╮  ╰────────╯ │
             ╰────────╯│             │
                       │  ╭────────╮ │
                       │  │ Task 7 │ │
                       ╰──┼●      ●┼─╯
                          ╰────────╯
```

We can define this workflow as follows:

```python
import dramatiq
from dramatiq_workflow import Workflow, Chain, Group

@dramatiq.actor
def task1(arg1, arg2, arg3):
    print("Task 1")

@dramatiq.actor
def task2():
    print("Task 2")

# ...

workflow = Workflow(
    Chain(
        task1.message("arguments", "go", "here"),
        Group(
            Chain(
                task2.message(),
                task5.message(),
            ),
            task3.message(),
            Chain(
                task4.message(),
                Group(
                    task6.message(),
                    task7.message(),
                ),
            ),
        ),
        task8.message(),
    ),
)
workflow.run()  # Schedules the workflow to run in the background
```

### Execution Order

In this example, the execution would look like this:

1. Task 1 runs (with arguments `"arguments"`, `"go"`, and `"here"`)
2. Task 2, 3, and 4 run in parallel once Task 1 finishes
3. Task 5 runs once Task 2 finishes
4. Task 6 and 7 run in parallel once Task 4 finishes
5. Task 8 runs once Task 5, 6, and 7 finish

*This is a simplified example. The actual execution order may vary because
tasks that can run in parallel (i.e. in a `Group`) are not guaranteed to run in
the order they are defined in the workflow.*

## Advanced Usage

### `WithDelay`

The `WithDelay` class allows delaying the execution of a task or a group of tasks:

```python
from dramatiq_workflow import Chain, Group, WithDelay, Workflow

workflow = Workflow(
    Chain(
        task1.message("arguments", "go", "here"),
        WithDelay(task2.message(), delay=1_000),
        WithDelay(
            Group(
                task3.message(),
                task4.message(),
            ),
            delay=2_000,
        ),
    )
)
```

In this example, Task 2 will run roughly 1 second after Task 1 finishes, and
Task 3 and will run 2 seconds after Task 2 finishes.

### Large Workflows

Because of how `dramatiq-workflow` is implemented, each task in a workflow has
to know about the remaining tasks in the workflow that could potentially run
after it. When a workflow has a large number of tasks, this can lead to an
increase of memory usage in the broker and increased network traffic between
the broker and the workers, especially when using `Group` tasks: Each task in a
`Group` can potentially be the last one to finish, so each task has to retain a
copy of the remaining tasks that run after the `Group`.

There are a few things you can do to alleviate this issue:

- Minimize the usage of parameters in the `message` method. Instead, consider
  using a database to store data that is required by your tasks.
- Limit the size of groups to a reasonable number of tasks. Instead of
  scheduling one task with 1000 tasks in a group, consider scheduling 10 groups
  with 100 tasks each and chaining them together.
- Consider breaking down large workflows into smaller partial workflows that
  then schedule a subsequent workflow at the very end of the outermost `Chain`.

Lastly, you can use compression to reduce the size of the messages in your
queue. While dramatiq does not provide a compression implementation by default,
one can be added with just a few lines of code. For example:

```python
import dramatiq
from dramatiq.encoder import JSONEncoder, MessageData
import lz4.frame

class DramatiqLz4JSONEncoder(JSONEncoder):
    def encode(self, data: MessageData) -> bytes:
        return lz4.frame.compress(super().encode(data))

    def decode(self, data: bytes) -> MessageData:
        try:
            decompressed = lz4.frame.decompress(data)
        except RuntimeError:
            # Uncompressed data from before the switch to lz4
            decompressed = data
        return super().decode(decompressed)

dramatiq.set_encoder(DramatiqLz4JSONEncoder())
```
